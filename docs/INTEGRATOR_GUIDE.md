1. What This Guide Covers

This document provides a complete integration pathway:

How to introduce the Love Formula inside an organisation

How to train staff to use it safely

How to use it with students, young people, or service-users

How to embed it in digital tools

How to run group activities

How to create a trauma-aware rollout

How to ensure ethical usage at all times

2. Purpose of Organisational Integration

Organisations adopt the Love Formula to:

Teach emotional intelligence

Build safer communication habits

Reduce conflict

Support young people in high-pressure environments

Provide tools for de-escalation

Encourage self-reflection

Improve group interaction

Build trauma-aware cultures


It is not a behaviour scoring system — it is a reflection system.


---

3. Ethical Ground Rules for Organisations

Before integrating the tool, organisations must commit to:

3.1 No Punishment

The Love Formula must never be used for disciplinary action.

3.2 No Surveillance

It must not be used to monitor or track individuals.

3.3 Optional Participation

Users must opt in voluntarily.

3.4 No labelling

Never say “your score is low” as a judgement.

3.5 Trauma sensitivity

Understand that communication is shaped by personal history.

3.6 Transparency

Explain to all participants what the tool does and what it doesn’t.

3.7 Human Interpretation Only

Scores are guides — not decisions.


---

4. How to Introduce the Love Formula Internally

Step 1 — Staff Briefing

Conduct a one-hour session covering:

Purpose of the tool

What the score represents

What it does not represent

Safe-use principles

Example scenarios

Role-play practice


Step 2 — Written Guidelines

Give staff a simple reference sheet with:

Allowed uses

Prohibited uses

What to say

What not to say

How to guide reflections


Step 3 — Soft Pilot

Test with:

Staff

Mentors

Group leaders


before involving young people or students.


---

5. Using the Love Formula With Young People or Students

5.1 Reflection First

The score is the start of a conversation, not the end.

Example:

> “This message seems intense — how were you feeling when you wrote it?”



5.2 Rewriting Exercises

Have users take a harsh message and rewrite it with kindness.

Then re-score.

5.3 Group Workshops

Show how different words change tone and intention.

5.4 Journalling Activities

Students write their thoughts → score → reflect → rewrite.

5.5 Emotional Literacy Sessions

Discuss what certain words communicate emotionally.

5.6 Conflict Support

Use the tool to slow things down before situations escalate.


---

6. Digital Integration for Organisations

You can integrate the Love Formula into:

internal web dashboards

student portals

mentoring apps

youth support systems

after-school programs

wellbeing apps


This is typically done through:

1. Creating a simple API endpoint using Flask or FastAPI


2. Sending text to the endpoint


3. Displaying the love_score output


4. Providing reflection prompts



Example display:

Love Score: 0.42
This message may feel emotionally heavy.  
Would you like help rewriting it in a calmer way?


---

7. Group Work Examples

7.1 Classroom “Tone Transform” Exercise

Students rewrite the same message in:

angry tone

neutral tone

kind tone


Then score each version.


---

7.2 Youth Centre “Pause & Reflect” Stations

A laptop or tablet with the Love Formula available.
Young people can check their message before sending it.


---

7.3 Conflict Mediation Pairs

Two people write how they feel separately, score it, and then discuss the differences.


---

7.4 Creative Writing

Use scores to explore character emotions and narrative tone.


---

8. Data Protection Rules

Organisations must:

Avoid storing messages unless absolutely necessary

Never attach scores to identity

Never build behaviour profiles

Delete input data regularly

Avoid automated logging

Protect user confidentiality


The tool must remain reflective, not intrusive.


---

Prepare written guidelines


Phase 2 — Small Pilot
