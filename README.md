• What the Love Formula Is


---

The Love Formula is a simple but powerful analytic tool that evaluates text for intent, tone, and relational impact using a love-centred framework.
It does not replace human judgement.
It does not score human worth.
It is a mirror, not a weapon.

This public version gives developers, researchers, educators and youth workers a safe way to explore:

Early-warning emotional indicators

Compassion-based decision frameworks

De-escalation tools

Reflective practice

Teaching emotional intelligence

🔹 Quick Start Example

from love_formula import love_score

text = "I appreciate your help today. Thank you for being patient."

score = love_score(text)
print(score)

Output:

## How the Love Score Works

The `love_score` is a **contextual alignment indicator**, not a judgment of character, value, or intent.

It is designed to act as a *mirror*, helping users reflect on tone, emotional direction, and relational impact within a piece of text. It does **not** determine truth, morality, or human worth, and it should never be used as a weapon, ranking system, or authority.

### What the Score Represents

- A score closer to **1.0** suggests language that reflects:
  - Calm intent
  - Appreciation or gratitude
  - Cooperative or de-escalating tone
  - Relational awareness

- A score closer to **0.0** suggests language that may indicate:
  - Emotional distress
  - Escalation risk
  - Defensive or reactive tone
  - Reduced relational clarity

These indicators are **contextual**, not absolute.

### What the Love Formula Analyses

The public release focuses on **non-invasive, human-first signals**, such as:
- Language tone and emotional direction
- Relational framing (self vs others)
- Intent signalling (supportive, neutral, distressed)

No biometric data, profiling, or surveillance inputs are used.

### Important Boundaries

- The Love Formula does **not** replace human judgment
- It does **not** diagnose mental states
- It does **not** label people
- It is intended for **reflection, safety, and awareness**

The score should always be interpreted **with compassion and context**.

Customisation and deeper extensions exist in the full system, but are intentionally excluded from the public release to prevent misuse.

Ethical AI alignment


Full safety guidelines: docs/SAFETY_AND_ETHICS.md


### Core Safety Principles

The Love Formula is designed with **human dignity, emotional safety, and ethical restraint** as foundational principles.

It must **not** be used for:
- Surveillance, profiling, or monitoring individuals
- Ranking, scoring, or judging people
- Punitive decision-making or automated enforcement

- Contextual understanding
- Consent where applicable
- Compassionate intent

The system is intentionally limited in the public release to reduce the risk of misuse or misinterpretation.

### Trauma-Aligned Design

This project follows a **trauma-aware, non-extractive approach**:
- No biometric data
- No behavioural surveillance
- No hidden inference or profiling
- No permanent labels or identities

The goal is **reflection and safety**, not control.

Any use of this tool should align with these principles.
