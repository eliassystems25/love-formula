🔹 What the Love Formula Is

The Love Formula is a simple but powerful analytic tool that evaluates text for intent, tone, and relational impact using a love-centred framework.
It does not replace human judgement.
It does not score human worth.
It is a mirror, not a weapon.

This public version gives developers, researchers, educators and youth workers a safe way to explore:

Early-warning emotional indicators

Compassion-based decision frameworks

De-escalation tools

Reflective practice

Teaching emotional intelligence

🔹 Quick Start Example

from love_formula import love_score

text = "I appreciate your help today. Thank you for being patient."

score = love_score(text)
print(score)

Output:

{'love_score': 0.87}
