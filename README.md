# Love Formula™ — Relational Integrity Model
Public Governance Specification

## Overview

Love Formula™ is a structured relational integrity modelling framework designed to evaluate tone, intent, and interaction impact within AI-supported environments.

It introduces a lightweight scoring architecture that “adds relational calibration logic to digital systems” without replacing underlying model capability.

Love Formula does not replace intelligence.
It introduces relational awareness.

## Governance Function

Love Formula™ functions as a relational integrity layer.

It provides:

- Intent-tone correlation modelling
- Relational density scoring
- De-escalation signal detection
- Impact trace evaluation
- Ralational-weighted calibration logic
 
The framework is model-agnostic and may be integrated into educational, advisory, and regulated environments.

## What Love Formula™ Provides

Love Formula™ introduces a repeatable evaluation method that:

- Assesses tone stability
- Identifies emotional volatility indicators
- Flags escalation pathways
- Encourages clarity and calm framing
- Supports reflective response modelling

It is designed to reduce relational instability without suppressing analytical capability.

## What Love Formula™ Is Not

Love Formula™ is not:

- A belief system
- A religious framework
- A moral enforcement engine
- A behavioural control mechanism
- A replacement for professional judgement

It encodes a structured method — not ideology.

## Core Design Principles

- Relational integrity prioritisation
- Transparency of scoring logic
- Non-coercive calibration
- Escalation awareness
- Human dignity preservation
- Clarity over emotional amplification

- ## Governance Positioning

Love Formula™ operates as:

- A relational modelling architecture
- A tone-impact evaluation layer
- A stability calibration mechanism

It does not override system intelligence.
It enhances relational awareness within decision ecosystems.

## Relationship to Governance Stack

Within the Elias Systems governance architecture, Love Formula™ operates alongside:

- EBOS™ — Behavioural modelling architecture
- EPL™ — Governance routing and guardrail layer
- 97/3 Immutable Core — Structural stability framework

Together, these components form a layered governance stack for AI-supported decision ecosystems.

## Repository Scope

This repository provides:

- Relational scoring logic reference
- Public documentation
- Example integration guidance

Implementation details may vary by deployment environment.

## Licensing

This framework is released under a structured ethical license.

Commercial licensing is available via Elias Systems Ltd.
